# Personal-Loans-Conversion-Analysis

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
To predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans (while retaining them as depositors).

## CONTEXT :
Mis-selling is very common in the Financial Sector. Despite the amount of insight on a customer and the processing power we have at our disposal, more than 50 percent of engaged customers get mistargeted communication. FX corporation has shown that segmented and targeted emails generate 58% of all revenue for a company. To make a company profitable, they need to fine-tune their marketing model to increase the revenue, because users will be more likely to make a purchase when they’re delivered exactly what they need.

As per the last campaign done by the financial institution for the liability customers, to convert them to personal loan holders, showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9.6% success. An analysis has been done on the previous campaign data to devise a campaign model with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget. Which in return will help the bank to make better ROA and increase their revenue.
